    "The main objective of this assignment is to process and analyse a collection text files containing legal agreements (e.g., NDAs) to prepare them for implementing a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system. This involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand the Cleaned Data : Gain a comprehensive understanding of the structure, content, and context of the cleaned dataset.\n",
    "* Perform Exploratory Analysis : Conduct bivariate and multivariate analyses to uncover relationships and trends within the cleaned data.\n",
    "* Create Visualisations : Develop meaningful visualisations to support the analysis and make findings interpretable.\n",
    "* Derive Insights and Conclusions : Extract valuable insights from the cleaned data and provide clear, actionable conclusions.\n",
    "* Document the Process : Provide a detailed description of the data, its attributes, and the steps taken during the analysis for reproducibility and clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate goal is to transform the raw text data into a clean, structured, and analysable format that can be effectively used to build and train a RAG system for tasks like information retrieval, question-answering, and knowledge extraction related to legal agreements."
